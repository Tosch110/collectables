## Collectables

Collectables are an ever growing segment of blockchain usage. They empower creative use cases from cryptokitties to business-models that allow renting, digital ownership control of an artwork to business shares or real estate. Blockchain collectables live on the public ledger and are defined as Non-divisible Fungible Token (NFT).

The user can create a NFT Token with a unique Blake3 hash. The higher the value of all the runes combined of the blake3 hash, the more powerful the NFT will be in a gamification scenario. In other usecases, the input of the NFT could take another form. In this scenario these tokens can be shared either against blockchain units or interact with another NFT Token.

Users will be able to challenge other users NFT Tokens. In case their score ranks higher, they will be awarded with the defiants NFT Token. Also, the winner NFT token gets +1 submitted to its winning streak while the loosing NFT token will get a +1 submitted to its loosing streak. The more points a NFT token earns as wins, the more powerful it will become. When the contestant looses, the defiant will become +1 to its winning streak and the contestant +1 to the loosing streak.
In case of a draw, the defiant wins.
